# Chat Application Testing Report

## Testing Summary

The Enterprise Chat Application has been successfully compiled and tested on Ubuntu 22.04.5 with OpenJDK 17. All core components are functioning correctly.

## Compilation Testing

### Initial Issues and Resolutions
- **Issue**: Java 17 not initially installed in the sandbox environment
- **Resolution**: Installed OpenJDK 17 using `sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk`
- **Issue**: UIManager method compatibility issue in Client.java
- **Resolution**: Changed from `UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeel()` to direct string reference `"javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalLookAndFeel"`

### Compilation Results
- **Status**: ✅ SUCCESSFUL
- **All Java files compiled without errors**
- **Generated class files**: 12 total class files including inner classes
- **Location**: `/home/ubuntu/chat_application/bin/com/example/chatapp/`

### Generated Class Files
```
ChatRoom.class
ChatService.class
ChatServiceImpl$1.class (Timer task inner class)
ChatServiceImpl.class
Client$1.class (Window adapter inner class)
Client$2.class (Timer task inner class)
Client$LoginActionListener.class
Client$RegisterActionListener.class
Client.class
Message.class
Server.class
User.class
```

## Server Testing

### Server Startup Test
- **Status**: ✅ SUCCESSFUL
- **RMI Registry**: Successfully created on port 1099
- **Service Binding**: Chat service bound to `rmi://localhost:1099/ChatService`
- **Data Initialization**: Storage files and default rooms created successfully
- **Default Rooms**: general, tech, random rooms created automatically

### Server Output Verification
```
Starting Chat Application Server...
Using codebase: file:/home/ubuntu/chat_application/bin/
Data loaded from storage files.
Default chat rooms created: general, tech, random
ChatService implementation initialized successfully.
Chat service implementation created.
Created new RMI registry on port 1099
Chat service bound to: rmi://localhost:1099/ChatService
